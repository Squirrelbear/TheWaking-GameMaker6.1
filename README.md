# The Waking - GameMaker 6.1

 A 3D zombie shooter developed using Game Maker 6.1 in 2006 in collaboration with Adam Tee for a school IT project. The game consists of two levels with three cutscenes. The first level has the player escaping an office filled with zombies and then escaping the building. The second level requires the player get to a car to escape the zombies. We made up the name Razor Edge Studios as a studio name that was only used for this one project.
 
# Requirements to Open/Run/Compile

To open the chaos6_theone.gm6 you will need the registered version of Game Maker 6.1.  Note that Game Maker 6.1 may need to be patched to run on Windows 10 or higher as it was developed for Windows XP. You may need to relink all the other files in source if you want to run the project. This can be done by going to Gobal Game Settings, then Include, click Add and select all the files and delete all the others listed.
